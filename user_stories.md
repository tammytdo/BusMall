User Stories

1. As the marketing research director, I want to know how many times each item is clicked, so that my client can estimate how much of each item to stock. 
2. As the developer, I want to represent each product multiple times, so that my group participants can have multiple opportunities to compare each item against two other items. 
3. As the focus group participant, I want an easy to use site that neatly displays images of each item, so that I can click the correct item each time.  
4. As the developer, I want a DRY program, so that I am not overwhelmed with a large amount of code.
